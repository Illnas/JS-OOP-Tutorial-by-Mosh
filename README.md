JS OOP Tutorial by "Programming with Mosh"


So, after I got declined another job aplication, I decided to focus on programming more than on waiting to be
declined.

One of the things I did avoid and one of the many things I did not get opportunity to learn at Algebra more in detail,
was OOP. Mind you, I did learn it few years ago, when it was still popular to use OOP in React, but I switched as fast I could
to FP. So, I decided to learn more about it. 

In this tutorial, I covered basics, which I already knew, there was few things I learned, but more or less, I knew all that.
I did find function constructors fun, but I am going to see if there is another OOP tutorial somewhere with classes.

In the meantime, I am doing SQL tutorial, so I will do another quick tutorial, and 
then do JS project to practice OOP.

Onwards to another project!!!
